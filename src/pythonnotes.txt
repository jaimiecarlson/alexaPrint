Notes from the Python Flask Tutorial:

requests library install - allows you to do get and post requests in python

Beautiful Soup library - sends HTML through it, parses it
install it through pip

bs4 in python

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_string)
soup.<tag> returns the first element with that tag
t.text => all text in the subtree rooted at t
can search the tree as well, find all of the emails in html, can provide regular expression of an email
can do data scraping

what about running a server in flask?

sample in Downloads/pennapps folder

Jinja features: most of page is HTML but it can respond programatically to input as well
python code within {% curly braces %}
creates a dynamic website for you

{%for item in things%}
<li> {%item %} </li>
{%endfor%}

from flask import requeset, redirect, url_for

can get arguments from get and post requests

POST data: request.form['key']

app.route

logging

my_flask.log

app.logger.debug()

Django - more stuff than Flask
Pyramid - more configurable

Dropbox - nicely annotated REST API
many web APIs transmit data in JSON
always wrap JSON in a top level dictionary because top level arrays can be hacked? apparently

json.dump() writes json to a file
json.load() loads JSON fomr a file

ssl
